# nanoSTL

A simplified version of C++ Standard Template Library

It provide similar but simpler interface of STL(C++11)

C++ STL somtimes is too large and complex to learn. I build this simplified one to make it easyier and test my own algorithm design ability.

This project has not been finished yet and all files end with ".hpp" for the sake of editing
