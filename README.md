# nanoSTL

A simplified version of C++ Standard Template Library

C++ STL somtimes is too large and complex to learn. I build this simplified one to make it easyier and test my own algorithm design ability.

nanoSTL provide similar interface of STL but it is not completely compatible with c++98 or c++11 standard for simplification.
